# asdfbitti.sh
asdfbitti.sh is a tool for patching squashfs live images such as Abitti for experimental and/or educational purposes. This tool was first released in 2020 and was quickly removed from github due to external pressures that do not apply anymore.

## Usage
Simply run `sudo ./asdfbitti.sh [path to image]`<br>
<br>
If you run out of RAM, it is recommended you change the `$TEMP_DIR` variable. The partition offsets are configured for Abitti's examinee image by default.
